 README
========

richard is a video index site.

It's pretty basic at the moment. I'm adding functionality as I need it for
`<http://pyvideo.org/>`_. If you're looking at this or using it at this
stage, then you're either a friend of mine or you're intrigued by the
future possibilities.

My priorities:

1. Maximize ease of finding the video you're looking for.
2. Minimize site upkeep and maintenance---it's an index and it should pretty
   much run itself.
3. Make it easy for others to help maintain the index data.
4. Minimize work for adding new video.

Features richard currently has:

* index of videos
* site news
* site-wide notifications
* support for HTML5 video
* hard-coded Universal Subtitles support for YouTube videos
* site search
* decent looking style
* decent documentation

Future things:

* feeds: every listing should have a feed view of it
* better more universal Universal Subtitles support
* better behavior for browsers with javascript disabled
* Do Not Track support
* on-site support for importing conferences of videos and individual
  videos


Versions
========

There is no released version of richard, yet. If you look at the commit
history, you'll see we're moving along with functionality. When we hit
a critical mass of important bits, we'll do a round of polish and release
a 0.1. Until then, if you want to use it, you should use it from git master.
