Want to help?
=============

I'd love to have help! Here are things I need help with:

* documentation work

  * verifying correctness of the existing documentation
  * fixing errors in the documentation
  * fixing TODO items in the documentation

* styling work

  * make the default site look better

* code work

  * correct egregious errors which are probably due to misunderstandings of
    how Django and other components work
  * working on issues in the issue tracker
  * fixing TODO items in the code

* testing work

  * write tests---there's test infrastructure, but no tests, yet which
    is totally lame
  * test richard---there are no tests, so it's likely there are issues
  * test richard on browsers other than Firefox nightly---I use Firefox
    nightly and haven't looked at richard on anything else
  * test richard on mobile devices---does it work well in tablets? does
    it work well on phones? what hardware does it not work well on?

* community work

  * do you know other groups looking for video index software? tell them
    about richard.

* project infrastructure work

  * is there infrastructure missing in this project that would make it
    easier for you to collaborate? if so, what?


"Gah! That's a huge list! It's too daunting!" That's ok! Hop on IRC
